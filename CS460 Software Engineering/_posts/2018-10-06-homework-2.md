Overview
------

Setup went quickly, established the branch and created the new folders. I copied over the index, img, css, and js folders from the first assignment. Once copied I striped the code of the remaining items of homework one.


Planning & Sketches
-----
It took a number of days to figure out what I was going to do. Eventually I stumbled across a suggestion form that linked out to a net worth [PDF Worksheet](http://www.schwabmoneywise.com/public/file/P-4038856/Net-Worth-Worksheet.pdf) and I decided to convert that PDF into a webpage.

**Fig. 1:** *Rough sketch of the main page.*

The idea was to have an accordian checkbox that allowed you to calculate only the sections selected. Then at the bottom it would list all the items again with the user inputted values. I had to cut that part for time.

Coding
------

I wrapped each form element in essentually the same html. I used the name element of the inputs as my call on for my jQuery.
```HTML
<tr>
	<td>Savings Account</td>
	<td>
		<div class="input-group mb-2">
			<div class="input-group-prepend">
				<span class="input-group-text">$</span>
			</div>
			<input class="form-control" type="number" name="cash" id="savings" />
		</div>
	</td>
</tr>
```

Next I created functions for each section of the table. this one specifically calls all inputs with the name of "cash" and add the value in the input to a var called sum and returns the value. I did this for each section changing out the appropriate name call.
```javascript
function findCash() {
  var sum = 0;
  $("input[name='cash']").each(function() {
    sum += +$(this).val();
  });
  return sum;
}
```

Next came adding the computed values to a list, triggered by a button press. I'm sure it could be more elegant and efficiant but pressed for time this is what I came up with:

```javascript
function computeNetWorth() {
  $("ul#netWorth > li").remove();
  // Current Assets
  var cashTotal = findCash();
  var investTotal = findInvested();
  var retireTotal = findRetirement();
  var busTotal = findBusiness();
  var useTotal = findUseAssets();

  // Current liabilities
  var currentLibTotal = findCurrentLiability();
  var longLibTotal = findLongLiability();

  var totalAssets = cashTotal + investTotal + retireTotal + busTotal + useTotal;
  var totalLibabilities = currentLibTotal + longLibTotal;

  var netWorth = totalAssets - totalLibabilities;

  if (cashTotal != 0) {
    $("#netWorth").append("<li>Cash and Cash Equivilent Assets: $" + cashTotal);
  }
  if (investTotal != 0) {
     $("#netWorth").append("<li>Invested Assets: $" + investTotal);
  }
  if (retireTotal != 0) {
    $("#netWorth").append("<li>Retirement Accounts: $" + retireTotal);
  }
  if (busTotal != 0) {
    $("#netWorth").append("<li>Business Ownership Intrests: $" + busTotal);
  }
  if (useTotal != 0) {
    $("#netWorth").append("<li>Use Assets: $" + useTotal);
  }
  if (currentLibTotal != 0) {
    $("#netWorth").append("<li class='negitive'>Current Liabilities: $" + currentLibTotal);
  }

  if (longLibTotal != 0) {
    $("#netWorth").append("<li class='negitive'>Long-Term Liabilities: $" + longLibTotal);
  }

  $("#netWorth").append("<li class='total'>Total Net Worth: $" + netWorth);

  if (netWorth > 0) {
    $('.total').addClass('positive');
  } else if (netWorth < 0) {
    $(".total").addClass('negitive')
  } else {
    $(".total").addClass('thanos')
  }
}
```
