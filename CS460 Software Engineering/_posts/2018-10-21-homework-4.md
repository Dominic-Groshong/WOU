Overview
------
This homework concept was to create our first ASP.NET site, using MVC5. On this site we would have a metric converter and a hex color combiner form which would use the get and push form methods.

Setup
------

The first step was to create a new "empty" MVC project, we used the standard template which provided the bootstrap framework and some basic views, controllers and other framework items. I then set up my .gitignore in the HW4 folder and tested to make sure it was working. Once done I made another branch for working on the homepage and the metric converter.


Homepage & Converter
------
The homepage and layout template was quick and easy to set up mainly just a matter of swapping out text to represent the new pages.
One issue I was unable to solve on the homepage was that one of my actionlink buttons did not work.

```csharp
	// This one worked
	@Html.ActionLink("Check it out", "Converter", "Home", new { @class = "btn btn-default" })
	// This one did not
	@Html.ActionLink("Check it out", "Index", "Hex", new { @class = "btn btn-default" })
```
However if I removed the ```new { @class = "btn btn-default" }``` from the second link it would work fine. The ActionLink also worked just fine in the layout template and my nav menu functioned correctly. I did not need to change anything in the controller for the index so I left that part alone. The next step was to work on the converter, I created the code in the controller first and then used the quick link to generate the view.
```csharp
public ActionResult Converter(){
	return View();
}
```
I then created my inputs using normal HTML as requested using HTTP GET
```html
<form role="form" method="get">

	<input type="number" class="form-control" name="miles" step="0.01">

	<label><input type="radio" name="unit" value="millimeters" checked> Millimeters</label>
	<label><input type="radio" name="unit" value="centimeters"> Centimeters</label>
	<label><input type="radio" name="unit" value="meters"> Meters</label>
	<label><input type="radio" name="unit" value="kilometers"> Kilometers</label>

	<button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Change dat number</button>

</form>
```
Next I added in some style items from bootstrap to make the page look nicer. From here I was able to move onto the controller again. First thing I did was check if the form submission had any information in it and if not return the page
```csharp
// If there is no get info available yet, return the view.
if (Request.QueryString["miles"] == null || Request.QueryString["unit"] == null)
{
  return View();
}
```

Next I Parsed the input string into the double parameter and added the unit request to its own variable.
```csharp
double miles = double.Parse(Request.QueryString["miles"]);
string unit = Request.QueryString["unit"];
```
Next I tested the miles to see if they were greater than 0 to prevent negative numbers. Once that was checked I did a series of if else statements that read in the unit and converted the miles dependent on the unit and output the resulting conversion to the viewbag. I did this for each unit. Thinking back I could have made this a switch operation.

example:
```csharp
// Preform this conversion if unit is kilometers
else if (unit == "kilometers")
{
	result = miles * 1.60934;
	ViewBag.conversion = miles + " miles equals " + result + " kilometers.";
}
```
I put all the code into a try/catch to prevent anyone from typing in something other than a number into the QuerryString. Calling this good I moved onto the color combiner portion of the assignment.

Color Combiner
------

First I created a new controller of Hex, and then a view in the same way as I did the conversion page. On the conversion page I used the razor helpers to generate the form code as following:



```
@using (Html.BeginForm(FormMethod.Post))
{
  @Html.Label("First Hex Color")
  @Html.TextBox("firstColor", null, new { @class = "form-control", placeholder = "#FFFFFF", pattern = "^#+([a-fA-F0-9]{6}|[a-fA-F0-9]{3})$", required = "required" })

  <br />

  @Html.Label("Second Hex Color")
  @Html.TextBox("secondColor", null, new { @class = "form-control", placeholder = "#EFEFEF", pattern = "^#+([a-fA-F0-9]{6}|[a-fA-F0-9]{3})$", required = "required" })

  <br />

  <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">Mix it up!</button>
}
```
I added a line for the ViewBag and moved onto my controller. The first step was to make sure my inputs were not empty, I did this using the IsNullOrEmpty bool
```csharp
if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(firstColor) || String.IsNullOrEmpty(secondColor))
{
  ViewBag.RenderMix = "<h3>Chill, back up a minute and fill out the form</h3>";
  return View();
}
```
Then if it was not empty I used the Color class to pull in the string input and change it to an RGB value.
```csharp
// Get the colors from the submited form.
Color colorOne = ColorTranslator.FromHtml(firstColor);
Color colorTwo = ColorTranslator.FromHtml(secondColor);
```
I then made another method to do the actual combining. My method of mixing was to take the two R, G, and B values from each color combine them and devide the resulting number by 2 geting the average. From some reading I did it is a more accurate measure of the resulting additive mixture. Once I had the results I created a new color using them. I did this using the following.

```csharp
// Get the combined values of the Red, Blue, Green fields devide by 2 to get average color.
	  int red = (colorOne.R + colorTwo.R) / 2;
	  int blue = (colorOne.B + colorTwo.B) / 2;
	  int green = (colorOne.G + colorTwo.G) / 2;

	  // Create the new color from the rgb int numbers.
	  mixedColor = Color.FromArgb(red, green, blue);
```
Once I had the resulting color I ran it through another method to create the ViewBag:

```csharp
private void renderMix(Color colorOne, Color colorTwo, Color colorThree)
{
ViewBag.RenderMix =
        "<div class='colorbox' style='background: rgb(" + colorOne.R + "," + colorOne.G + "," + colorOne.B + ");'></div>"
      + "<div class='colorbox text'><p>+</p></div>"
      + "<div class='colorbox' style='background: rgb(" + colorTwo.R + "," + colorTwo.G + "," + colorTwo.B + ");'></div>"
      + "<div class='colorbox text'><p>=</p></div>"
      + "<div class='colorbox' style='background: rgb(" + colorThree.R + "," + colorThree.G + "," + colorThree.B + ");'></div>";
}
```

Once that was done I recorded my video and uploaded it below.
