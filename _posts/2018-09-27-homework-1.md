Overview
------
For this first homework, weâ€™re required to manually code HTML and CSS, while practicing with Git. The website is built with Bootstrap v4, common prebuilt CSS and JavaScript library.

Step 1: GIT
------

The first step was to install the command line version of git. This was easy since due to my work it was already installed.
```bash
$ git --version
git version 2.19.0.windows.1
```
I created a new repository on the github.com site and pulled it to my general repository folder. This went quickly and I already had my username and password setup so pushing back to the repository had no issues.

Step 2: HTML5
------

It has been many years since I have hand written HTML, I probably spent 3-4 hours attempting to get around it writing HTML manually. I've been making websites for over a decade now and the last six years I have used Drupal for everything. Thus having to manually add in headers, footer, sidebars, menus, etc. to every page was painful. I started by attempting to using PHP (which I found out wont work on git pages), from there I tried to use HTML5 embeds (these "work" but embed an entire HTML document with their own <html> document), after that failed I went to jQuery and got the following code working:

```javascript
$("#header").load("resources/header.html");
```

This all went out the window once I found out we should not use JavaScript for this first assignment.

After this point I worked on getting my site designed using bootstrap. Fought with getting the bootstrap classes in the correct order for things like the menu and grid.

#### Bootstrap Code Reference

I don't use bootstrap generally so I used the [documentation](http://getbootstrap.com) page to figure out the classes I would need, it is a bit of a nightmare figuring out all the nesting.  

I did not host the bootstrap files locally and instead used the bootstrap CDN. I need to go through and determine which of these is truly needed and what can be deleted. Some of the scripts are carry overs from when I was trying to use jQuery.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Gn5384xqQ1aoWXA+058RXPxPg6fy4IWvTNh0E263XmFcJlSAwiGgFAW/dAiS6JXm" crossorigin="anonymous">

```

Menus are a tricky beast, there are so many classes you have to add to the list items, wrapping divs, and the anchor tags. This is the code I used to get them working, followed an example online but did not note down from which website.
```html
<div class="container">
	<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg">
		<ul class="navbar-nav">
			<li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Home</a></li>
			<li class="nav-item dropdown"><a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="mainMenuDropdown" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">About</a>

			<div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="navbarDropdownMenuLink">
				<a class="dropdown-item" href="history.html">History</a>
			</div>

			</li>
			<li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
		</ul>
	</nav>
</div>
```

Columns seamed to cause a lot of people in class problems. To get mine working I need to remember to use the containter -> row -> col-lg-x classes.
```html
<div class="container body-copy">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			<h2>Second Column</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<h1>Second Column</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

Step 3: CSS
------

The CSS was quick and easy, front end development is my jam. I did not change a whole lot from the default bootstrap styles. I updated the menu bar with custom colors, I also used a reset style sheet from [this person](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) since I always prefer to start with a fresh slate for the most part.

Generally I use SASS for CSS but in this case I did not feel like setting up a project and using my compiler for such a tiny site.
