Overview
------
This homework concept was to convert a Java program into a C# while learning the new syntax and some of the new ways that C# does things.

Setup
------

To start we needed to download and install the Visual Studio IDE.

![Downloaded](/assets/imgs/hw3/ide.png)

After downloading I installed several of the packages for the ones I assumed we would use throughout the term.


Content / Coding
------
First thing I did was set up a .gitignore file, it took a few tweaks mainly in how much of the path to include but eventually I was able to get it to ignore everything I did not want.

```bash
#ignore Java files

HW3/java/

#ignore files except .cs files

HW3/conversion/*
HW3/conversion/conversion/*


!HW3/conversion/conversion
!HW3/conversion/conversion/*.cs
```

Then I started working on the conversion. I followed the general path you suggested for conversion order.

1. Node.java ⟶ Node.cs
2. QueueInterface.java ⟶ IQueue.cs
3. QueueUnderflowException.java ⟶ QueueUnderflowException.cs
4. LinkedQueue.java ⟶ LinkedQueue.cs
5. Main.java ⟶ Program.cs

I really enjoyed programing in C# aside from the naming conventions, I am pretty sure I still don't have those right... I need to spend more time going through the conventions document since they seam so arbitrary to me at the moment.

The conversion went quickly and only took a couple of hours. The parts that slowed me down were with:

```csharp
  // Program.cs
  n = int.Parse(args[0]);

  // This got me since I kept trying to use the Integer class
```

```csharp
   // LinkedQueue.cs  -- Pop method
   T tmp = default(T);

   // the original null statement did not work
```
Everything else converted as I expected and with the lectures and the group that meets before class I was able to figure them out pretty easily.


Testing
-------

I downloaded OBS and wanted to test recording things since we will not have the ability to have them as a secondary page like in the first two.
