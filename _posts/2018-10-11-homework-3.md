Overview
------
This homework concept was to convert a Java program into a C# while learning the new syntax and some of the new ways that C# does things.

Setup
------

To start we needed to download and install the Visual Studio IDE.

[Setup] Get your development environment set-up: download and install Visual Studio IDE. (Community 2017 free version is fine); DO NOT USE THE MAC VERSION. It is not the same product and will not do what we need this year.

[Setup] Download the Java application provided here: javacode2.zip. Review the code; and compile and run to learn what it does. This version is different from last year.


Content / Coding
------

[Content/Coding] Start a new C# console application whose code is inside a HW3 folder in your Git repository. Add and commit your project files and code just like normal, but do use Visual Studio's .gitignore file so that the multitude of unnecessary files are not shouting to be added to Git. As with the last homework, all work for this homework should be done in a new feature branch with multiple commits over time.

[Content/Coding] Write C# class files and code as necessary to duplicate the behavior of the required code. You should try to stick as close as possible to the Java code, so translate it -- don't do it your own way. This is because I have purposefully chosen certain language features that I want you to learn in C#.

Don't try to copy in the Java code and edit it to fix errors. You want to write it from scratch so you begin to learn the Visual Studio IDE style of development (i.e. code completion, IntelliSense, looking up documentation, keyboard shortcuts ...). You should have multiple commits showing how you wrote this from scratch.

I highly suggest that you implement the classes in this order:

Node.java ⟶ Node.cs
QueueInterface.java ⟶ ?.cs
QueueUnderflowException.java ⟶ QueueUnderflowException.cs
LinkedQueue.java ⟶ LinkedQueue.cs
Main.java ⟶ ?.cs

[Content/Coding] Where the syntax is identical between C# and Java you of course do not need to change anything. However, C# makes use of new language features to solve common tasks and you should learn and use those (looking at you properties). Little things are important, for example C# has a String class but convention says you use the string type name -- so please do that. Please follow all C# conventions for naming things (names that start with upper case for example). The code does not have to be 100% exactly the same as long as the behavior is the same. Yes, you'll need to find the equivalent of System.out.println, LinkedList, StringBuilder, generics, ... Don't worry about making accessibility modifiers the same.

You must implement and use the linked queue as was done in the java code, but you should use C#'s linked list or equivalent.

Testing

I downloaded OBS and wanted to test recording things since we will not have the ability to have them as a secondary page like in the first two.
