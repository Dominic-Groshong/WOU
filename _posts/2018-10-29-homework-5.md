Overview
------
What do you do when your refrigerator stops working? If you're lucky enough to be living in Campus Apartments then you can simply go to your landlord's website and submit a request for maintenance. Explain what is wrong and voila, your super responsive and caring building manager will come running to fix or replace it.

We want to make an online version of this form for renters plus a page for the building manager. So two pages (in addition to the home landing page): one for renters to fill out and submit this form, and another for the building manager to view all current requests, sorted by date and time submitted. The following questions suggest how you should go about this.

Setup
------
Same as all the other MVC projects, I set up a "blank" project and started working from that.

Coding
-------
I started with the model, making fields for the seven different form items adding in the new data annotations like the following:

```csharp
[Display(Name = "First Name")]
[Required(ErrorMessage = "Please enter your first name")]
[MaxLength(50)]
public string FirstName { get; set; }

// Only differing one was the date posted which I did like this:
private DateTime date = DateTime.Now;
[Display(Name = "Time Requested")]
public DateTime RequestAt
{
  get { return date; }
  set { date = value; }
}
```

I repeated that for each form item, changing the variable type as appropriate. The one thing I found out later which caused a problem was that I needed to add a key variable. Until I did I kept getting the following error message:

![keyError](/assets/imgs/hw4/error.png)

Once that error was figured out everything went smoothly.

The next thing I did was create my DAL folder and Context file. Not much to say on this I just followed the example you uploaded and changed out the names.

While working on the context I created the database and the up.sql and down.sql. Kept my down exactly like yours and dropped the whole table. In the up I added all the extra fields, the only hiccup with the up I ran into was that Message was already a taken word so I had to change my Model to reflect the new Comment naming.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[AssistanceRequests]
(
[ID]		      INT IDENTITY (1,1)	NOT NULL,
[FirstName]	  NVARCHAR(50)		NOT NULL,
[LastName]	  NVARCHAR(50)	 	NOT NULL,
[Phone]       NVARCHAR(12)     NOT NULL,
[Building]    NVARCHAR(20)     NOT NULL,
[Suite]       INT              NOT NULL,
[Comments]  NVARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
[Access]      BIT            NOT NULL,
[RequestAt]		DateTime			NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT [PK_dbo.AssistanceRequests] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([ID] ASC)
);
```
I then moved onto the connection string which I copied from your example and pasted my string path into.

```HTML
<connectionStrings>
    <add name="AprtRequest" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=D:\GitHub\xzonos.github.io\HW5\database\database\App_Data\AprtRequest.mdf;Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
  </connectionStrings>
```

After that I was able to make my new controller, I also auto generated one and used that in writing my own. To sort the table view by date I passed in the following to my index view:

```csharp
public ActionResult Index()
{
// Linq commands to sort the list by time
var time = from t in db.AssistanceRequests
			 orderby t.RequestAt ascending
			 select t;
return View(time);
}
```
The rest was just stylizing the form fields with bootstrap which I am extremely comfortable with.
