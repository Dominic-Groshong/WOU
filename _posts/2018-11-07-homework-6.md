Overview
------
After speaking with stakeholders at WWI it is determined that they want a web page with a prominent search bar. Typing in a name, or part of a name and hitting return or clicking the search button will search the companies database for a list of names that match. For the second part, If the person is a customer then they want to see some details about their company and WWI's sales to it.

Setup
------
Same as all the other MVC projects, I set up a "blank" project and started working from that. The difference this time around was setting up the existing database and using SQL server, and reverse generating the models from that database.

I downloaded the new programs we would need for setting this up and imported the existing database into it. Connecting through the SQL server that now runs on the machine.

Coding
-------
### Feature 1
First issue I ran into was that any time I restarted my machine the server would shut down and not restart. This caused me some grief until I was able to figure out how to manually restart it by going through Administrative Tools -> Services -> SQL Server  (right clicking and choosing start).

The first feature was pretty quick to initialize. I stated by building the search view first, establishing my razor form

```Html
@using (Html.BeginForm("Search", "Querry", FormMethod.Get))
{
<div class="searchConainer">
	<input type="text" class="form-control" name="search" placeholder="Enter Name" required>
	<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary searchIcon">Search</button>
</div>
}
```
I used the [HttpGet] to pass the search query through the database using a linq query
```csharp
public ActionResult Search(string search)
{
// If the search string is empty return an empty view.
if (search == "" || search == null)
{
	return View();
}

// Otherwise run the search
else
{
	var List = NameList(search);
	ViewBag.Bit = 1;
	return View(List);
}
}
```
My first display uses a method that calls the database on the FullName field and searches for anything containing the input string.
```csharp
private List<PersonVM> NameList(string search)
{
List<PersonVM> ListNames = db.People
.Where(n => n.FullName.Contains(search))
.Select(n => new PersonVM
{
	FullName = n.FullName
}).ToList();
return ListNames;
}
```
then to send the name back to the controller to trigger the full details I use an action link
```csharp
@Html.ActionLink(item.FullName, "IndividualDetails", "Querry", new { Name = item.FullName }, new { @class = "searchItem" })
```
once that was done I created a PersonVM and pulled in only the fields we needed. Once that was created I was able to create a new query calling a new PersonVM like so:
```csharp
private List<PersonVM> PersonDetails(string Search)
{

var Details = db.People
.Where(p => p.FullName.Equals(Search))
.Select(p => new PersonVM
{
	PersonID = p.PersonID,
	FullName = p.FullName,
	PreferredName = p.PreferredName,
	PhoneNumber = p.PhoneNumber,
	FaxNumber = p.FaxNumber,
	EmailAddress = p.EmailAddress,
	MemberSince = p.ValidFrom,
	Customer = p.Customers2
}).ToList();

return Details;
}
```
That finished up the first feature, I just had to create the detail page and call each item into the page using ```@Model.Person.FirstOrDefault().[FieldName]```

### Feature 2
This took FOREVER, but after numerous hours I found the way that works best for me. I created a grouped ViewModel, that holds an instance of a PersonVM, CustomerVM, LineItemVM, Latitude, Longitude, TotalOrder, GrossSales, and TotalProfit. I ended up creating a multitude of helper methods, that used the customerID to pull information into the view model that way I could call VarableName.Customer and pull information from it.

For example:
```csharp
private int CountOrders(int ID)
{
int totalOrders = db.Orders
.Where(o => o.CustomerID.Equals(ID))
.Count();

return totalOrders;
}
```
Another example:
```csharp
private List<CustomerVM> CompanyDetails(int ID)
{
  var Details = db.Customers
.Where(c => c.PrimaryContactPersonID.Equals(ID))
.Select(c => new CustomerVM
{
	CustomerID = c.CustomerID,
	CustomerName = c.CustomerName,
	PhoneNumber = c.PhoneNumber,
	FaxNumber = c.FaxNumber,
	WebsiteURL = c.WebsiteURL,
	MemberSince = c.ValidFrom,
}).ToList();

  return Details;
}
```
### Extra Credit
I used leafletjs and openstreetmap.org for the tile set. I used the view model to pass in the latitude and longitude.

```Html
<div id="mapid"></div>
<!-- Script here actual intializes the longitude and latitude-->
<script>
// center of the map
var center = [@Model.Latitude,@Model.Longitude];

// Create the map
var map = L.map('mapid').setView(center, 13);

// Set up the OSM layer
L.tileLayer(
	'http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
	maxZoom: 18
	}).addTo(map);

// add a marker in the given location
L.marker(center).addTo(map);
</script>
```
