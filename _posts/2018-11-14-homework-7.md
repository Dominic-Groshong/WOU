Overview
------
Create a simple word to GIF translator which uses the Giphy API to send requests and return the results using a json package. Then we want to log any requests to the API in a database.

Setup
------
Same as all the other MVC projects, I set up a "blank" project and started working from that. I saved setting up the database until the end, but I went with a local database just like in Homework 5.

Coding
-------
This went very quickly in comparason to last week. I started with a truly empty MVC and added my GiphyController first. Next I created an Index view, deleted all the extra junk from the Layout shared file and added a input[type="text"] to the page. I also added a div with an ID for placing the returned values. Next I created a custom JavaScript file and added it to the view using

```html
@section scripts{
  <script type="text/javascript" src="~/Scripts/GifyRequest.js"></script>
}
```

and on the layout using

```cs
@RenderSection("scripts", required: false)
```

this allows for the custom script to be added into the bottom of all pages (not super useful for this since its a single page project).

The next step was to get the JS to send the results to the controller. I started with writing a new route as seen below:

```cs
routes.MapRoute(
	name: "Get Word",
	url: "{controller}/{action}/{inputWord}",
	defaults: new { controller = "Giphy", action = "SendData" }
);
```
I had some struggle with getting this route to function but then I realized I needed to have it inside the RegisterRoutes and not as a completely separate item.

Once I had this route I was able to use the JS to send to the controller,  I did this by using the .keypress(function e) on my input, and then used an if statement to check if e.which == 32. This searches for any space bar input. When it detects the space bar it grabs the whole val, splits it by " " and then I pop() the last value off the array.

```javascript
$('input:text').keypress(function (e) {

  // if spacebar is pressed
  if (e.which == 32) {

    // get the value
    var list = $(this).val()
    // split the value into a list
    list = list.split(" ");
    // get the last item in the list array
    var word = list.pop();
 }
});
```

Once i get the last word inputed with pop() I check that word to see if it exists in two other arrays which Tiffany found online [here]:https://gist.github.com/ijmacdowell/8325491 I used ```javascript (jQuery.inArray(word, verbs) !== -1 ``` to check if the word was in the chosen array. If it was then I used the following:

```javascript
var source = "/Giphy/SendData/" + word;
// Send an async request to our server, requesting JSON back
$.ajax({
	type: "GET",
	dataType: "json",
	url: source,
	success: displayData,
	error: errorOnAjax
});
```

this successfully passed the word to the controller. If the word was not in the array I had it just .append to the display ID.

Once the word was passed to the controller I used async to send my requests. This is when I set up my external appSettings.config file and added my API key to that file. Once created I added it to the Web.config file in my main project. Once I had my API key I got it out using the ConfigurationManager and stored it in a string. Next I created a new HttpClient and used the GetAsync to send the url with attached key and input word:

```cs
public async Task<JsonResult> SendData(string inputWord)
	{
	  // Get the API key from the setting file
	  string Key = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ApiKey"];

	  // Establish connection to the API
	  var GetURL = await new HttpClient().GetAsync("http://api.giphy.com/v1/stickers/translate?api_key=" + Key + "&s=" + inputWord);
	  var Content = await GetURL.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

	  // Parse out just the data section from the string
	  var data = JObject.Parse(Content)["data"].ToString();

	  // Parse out just the embed_url from the large mass of data
	  var embed = JObject.Parse(data)["embed_url"].ToString();

	  return Json(embed, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);
  }
```
Once I sent the url and recieved content back I parsed that content to get just the data and then parsed it again to get just the embed_url out of that data and sent it back to the javascript as a json.

in my javascript all I had to add was the following
```javascript
function displayData(data) {
  $("#display").append("<iframe src= " + data + " width=100 height=100 frameBorder=0 allowFullScreen ></iframe >");
}
```
as you can see here I append the data into the src of a iframe.

The next part was to get verious details about the person making the request and store them in a database. I created a new local database using all the steps from Homework 5, created a context, added the connection string, created a model, a up.sql and down.sql. Once set up I was able to add the following to my controller
```cs
// Get the ip and browser information
      var ip = Request.UserHostAddress;
      var browser = Request.Browser.Type;

      // Create a new log
      var log = new Log
      {
        Date = DateTime.Now,
        Word = inputWord,
        URL = embed,
        IP = ip,
        Browser = browser
      };

      // Add the new log to the database and save
      db.Logs.Add(log);
      db.SaveChanges();
```
