The first step for publishing to Azure was to create a resource group for everything to sit in.

The next was to create a Azure database

Next I added my firewall exception which did not help since each time I moved location or restarted I had to add it again.

Then in my up sql script I was able to connect to the database on Azure.

I than ran my up.sql and was able to view the new tables in sql manager.

Changed my connection string on visual studio

Added a new app and added the connection string info.
