Overview
------

Step 1: Setup
------

After adding a new folder the first step was to create a new repository branch and change to working on that branch. I have not worked much with branches since most of my experiance with git has been solo and while bad practice generally always work on the master branch.

First I created the new branch:
```bash
git branch homeworkTwo
```

Next I switched to the new branch:
```bash
git checkout homeworkTwo
```
This established the new working branch and I could proceed to creating my files. I copyed over my JavaScript folder, css folder, and index.html file from the first homework assignment and proceeded to strip them down to the bare necessity's.



**[Setup]** Create a new folder in your Git repository, preferably named HW2. Create a new feature branch for your work on this homework, check it out and proceed. Create an index.html and stylesheet (e.g. styles.css) directly in that folder. Write your CSS in this stylesheet file. You can write the Javascript directly in the html file if you want.

**[Planning & Design]** Think for a bit about what you'd like to do. You need to take input from the user, do some calculation and then provide the output/answer back to the user by modifying elements on the page and adding new elements.

Here's an example that is too easy: a page that lets the user convert a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit. In this example you'd need a text input for the Celsius temperature, a "Convert" button and a location for the output like a paragraph element with "Answer: " text. When the button is pressed, your Javascript callback function is executed which uses jQuery to retrieve the temperature, plain Javascript to calculate the correct temperature in Fahrenheit and then jQuery to change the text in that paragraph element.

This example, however, isn't good enough because it only uses two form elements and doesn't create a list or table element. (There's another example linked from the main class page that is a little closer. It generates a table but only uses one input element, doesn't use Bootstrap and can be broken -- try a date that is clearly out of range.)

Do something fun, not too complicated, and interesting.

**[Planning & Design]** Create a wireframe or sketch of your page to help you with the design. A good idea is to overlay it with the rows and columns of your selected Bootstrap grid, and plan for how it will look when the page is resized. Label it with with the container, row, and column classed elements to visualize your layout. (Remember that you can open a Bootstrap page, like this one, in a browser and visualize the HTML elements and styling with the inspector from the developer's tools, as shown in class.)

**[Content/Coding]** Create your working page, remembering to style it nicely and to use Bootstrap for your layout. As with HW 1, you'll need a minimum of 2 files: index.html and styles.css plus a *.js file if you feel like putting your javascript in a separate file also.

**[Test]** Commit and push your work frequently on your feature branch but don't merge until you are happy with it and have tested it thoroughly. For example, it should not fail if you're expecting a number and the user types in an arbitrary string. A feature branch should continue until the feature is finished and tested before merging into any main release branch.

To make sure your feature branch shows up in the commit history, at some point make sure to put at least one commit on master before merging. The actual work in the commit doesn't matter; you could just edit the README. This will advance that branch past the branching point and will leave it nicely visible.

**[Turn It In]** Finally, merge your feature branch back into master and push to your remote repository.
[Portfolio Content] Everything goes into your Portfolio: writeup of important HTML + CSS + Javascript (especially the JS since that's what this is about), css, nicely commented of course, a screenshot of the rendered webpage, your wireframe, link to the working page and any notes you've generated. (You are keeping notes of what you're learning, right?)
